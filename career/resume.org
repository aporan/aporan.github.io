# *** Social Project for Children with Autism {{{span(Sep’16 - Nov’17)}}}
# 
#     Special needs children may be able to excel in programming. The
#     project involved research, user data collection, designing, and
#     testing a new curriculum to teach children basic coding concepts.
# 
#     - Analysing base performance by conducting several tests, surveys
#       and measuring their memory and sequential task handling
#       capability.
#     - Data classification and curriculum design in a fun and analogous
#       manner which teaches core concepts of programming.
#     - Students who were able to partially communicate where able to
#       perform all programming related tasks which involved recreating
#       lego blocks from memory, reading and correctly recreating steps
#       of visual code blocks, and finally solving difficult challenges
#       with little to no assistance.

#     paths and helped programmed some motors. 
# 
#     - Worked in a student team of 6 people from different technical
#       tracks.
#     - Implemented an ad-hoc network with static IP for P2P connections
#       between two RaspberryPi.

*** Bytedance Pte. Ltd. ~ Site Reliability Engineer (Security) {{{span(Nov’22 - Now)}}}

    SRE in charge of 2 direct security products in a team of 25. I also
    manage/provision our internal Kubernetes cluster including standard
    sysadmin responsibilities

    * Designed and implemented application metrics which captured errors which
      were eventually converted to P0 (user facing alerts), reducing the P0
      stats by over 50%
    * Metrics redesign helped to negotiate a clear SLA with our stakeholders
      with a enforced, data backed agreement of 99.9% which established a
      Runbook
    * Correlated cpu, memory information which was piped into metrics with
      host data to provided yearly estimates of resources using a simple
      linear regression model.
    * Identified an intermittent race condition by initially using a
      flamegraph generated by using a go profiler.
    * strace and gdb helped to identify a race condition due to futex_wait
      which helped in reducing the resource application and help boost
      application perforance.
    * Stabilized apache Kafka platform which consistenly produces 76 Million
      messages/sec. Identified critical bottlenecks and proposed redesign of
      the system architecture to handle congestion. The system recovered
      without any data loss.
    * Provisioned Hashicorp/vault in a high availability cluster backed by
      Oracle KMS and a secondary vault to perform auto-unseal:
      https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/seal/ocikms
    * Introduced blue-green/canary deployment concepts to infrastructure team
      with 0 downtime upgrade of applications.
    * Reduced the runtime of Apache Flink job processing 20+Tb of data 10+
      from 12+ hours to 4.
    * Managed, reviewed, provisioned host instances, deployed application as
      K8s deployment/rollout/statefulset, scraped cluster metrics using
      prometheus agent, and collected logs using Loki.
    * Conducted standard DevOps/Testing practices including regression
      testing and torture tests 
    * Actively prompted R&D to use Alpine Linux based images by providing
      example-led demonstration by reducing image size which saved in storage costs.
    * Introduced go-mmproxy which attaches client address infront of the TCP
      packet header to preserve ip addresses in Layer 4 of the OSI model
    * Automated several dry operations which installs, provisions, fix various
      adhoc tasks using python, go, and bash.
    * Regularly particpated in global-oncall with colleagues in 4 different
      timezone, while managing internal customer requriements across 4
      cultures.
