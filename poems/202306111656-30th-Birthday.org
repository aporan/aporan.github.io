Sitting alone in the darkness,
In the middle of the seat,
can’t really sleep,
can’t really move

With access to the world 
from the palm of my hands,
i am on my way,
to my second home

A quiet 30th birthday,
With a dash of music,
and a lot of convos,
with my favorite folks, 
and a hot drink!

Not too much, nor too little,
it’s almost, almost
the way i’d like it.
