People of society,
Why thee so polar,
Every brethren yearns to be heard and helped,
Every sistren yearns to be heard and helped, but
Instead of thou helping every self,
You protect your ownself.

Why do be so?
Is it because we worship thee, and 
there is no one like me.

Now isnâ€™t that,
a humorous irony.

Context: It's about working with another person and communication. I and
naively so like Lex Friedman believed that it is better to help people,
always. But there is a big downside to this.

From a systematic perspectives, this falls back to Nash Equilibrium and Game
Theory 101: Everyone should also be willing to help each other out, otherwise,
people who naively want to help, would always be taken for a ride down free
advantage highway.

For people who want to help, they don't really have a choice. Dictated by
mathematics, they out to prolong the societies game and start concerning more
about their own situation.

Hmm, or do they .. ;)
