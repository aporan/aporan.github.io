I know of Rumi,
but didn't know he was a Sufi,
A mystic of the arts,
who said the world always gives,
what they seeks.

It was an unexpected trip,
more so cause of you,
A msg out of the ordinary,
evolved to something to forward to.

Nothing was expected,
nor anything was assumed,
An exchange of thoughts,
without any goals.

The trip was full of visits,
with fam, friends, and colleagues,
but throughout my trip, 
a constant remained,
messages that were from you.

I shared about my trip,
places i went, things I did,
while you too shared activities,
that you did, missed, or enjoyed.

I learned about you, 
your stance and ambition,
And I shared mine, 
a path full of attrition.

Life's a terrible teacher,
it flows, doesn't build,
in the midst of the current,
how do you find your other?

Even I'm not the same,
when I was younger,
changes in want, changes in desire,
changes in the outlook of life itself.

One thing i knew was,
that values mattered,
and that's something that emerged,
an alignment, a hope from null.

Your outlook was strong,
about life, religion, and future,
I thought that you were heard,
about things that mattered,
for the other.

Values might have matched,
but the direction did not,
and so, 
A new wisdom learnt.

As one grows old, 
they are faced with reality,
one sad part about that is,
one loses touch with their fantasy.

Maybe i should have thought about it,
and anticipated a fantasy,
the change of messages,
should've made it a reality.

There's nothing more to do,
But to learn goals and be new.
although the goals should differ,
as I am not from here.

But that is why,
I bring a different view,
a different vision, travel, and a dream,
for the other who'd be new.

The chance, however,
who brings peace inner peace,
may not be easier, but i'm still hopeful,
for the other.

Context: Well, as you can guess. 30yrs of age is about the time to write
this sort of thing.

I write poems to share what my experience, it's the same for my photography,
to share what I see. But, I had to think about this one. I don't want it to be
only my side of the story, but also my understanding of the opposition. I will
likely be wrong, but regardless, it's hard to mind read.

It's hard to truly know what others experience, so it's also going to be hard
to write for them, but I have found a way. An experience shared through
inputs, yet another simple concept from computer science.
