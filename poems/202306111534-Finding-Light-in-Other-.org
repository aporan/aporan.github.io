It was an unexpected trip,
more so cause of you,
A msg out of the ordinary,
Nothing expected, nothing assumed,
Take it like any other,
without any hope.

The trip was full of visits,
solo and with fam,
but throughout my trip, 
our msgs were constant.

Every single day,
there was something to look forward to,
A jolly msg that is from you.

I shared about my trip,
places i went,
while you too shared activities that you went.

I learned about you, 
your stance and ambition,
And I shared mine, 
a path full of attrition.

Life has taught me, 
a constant of life is,
it's always uncertain.

How do you find the other,
in an ever changing world,
Even I'm not the same,
as i was in my adolescent years.

The only way i know was,
to focus on values,

# Nor looks, nor money, 

And that's something that stood out,
to me in our conversations.

# a sense of calm

I was excited, 
probably a bit too much,
life taught me yet again,
not to do it too much.

Values maybe the same,
but the direction matters,
and so,
A new Wisdom was learnt.

As one grows old, 
they are faced with reality,
one sad part about that is,
they lose touch with their fantasy.

Maybe i should have thought about it,
and anticipated the fantasy.
Anyway, there's nothing much to do,
But to change again and be new.

Maybe that's why there is a delta,
between me and the Other,
I'm too much of a pragmatist,
While they may beg to differ.

I may not be from here,
but that brings a different view,
a different vision, travel hopes and opinion.
If penalties could be forgiven in other parts of the world,
Perhaps, maybe you could too,
believe in second chance.

In anycase, I'm still hopeful,
for finding the Other. 
Although, the chance of finding another 
who brings peace inner peace,
may not be easier.
