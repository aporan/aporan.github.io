What is this sensation?
This ability of perception,
Is it a gift or a curse,
To not submit to the major farce. 

Is it for something unique?
Perhaps to find some insight,
Or to shed some light.

Why though, what does it bring?
Discarding emotions and knowing within.
Responsive emotions is the desire,
What makes it helpful to expire.

One thing it could be,
that they are overwhelming,
causing more trouble,
than one can fulfill.

But if it's THE connection,
that everyone wants,
what's the cause of not having,
Life's standard perception.

Context: Friends and folks have always mentioned that I don't listen, but they
have never been able to put into words what they exactly mean. I have always
understood their situation, their context, their dispotion of a certain
settings, and I always knew that they wanted to be /heard/. 

I always gave them/tried to provide them example situations so that they are
able to discuss. Whoever maybe reading this may thing that I was giving
solutions, but that was not the case. The idea was to give them an open
environment to discuss about their problems, so that they were able to express
their emotions and prompt a conversation.

What I found, however, is that people don't really want that either. They just
want folks to listen, so that they are heard. But no one has been able to
describe to me what that means.

The poem is about what I think it means. I am tempted to say they just want to
relate, but that is not the case. People want their emotional thoughts to be
'absorbed', which includes many things, but foremost of it is an
acknowledgement of the charged emotions.

Without out, all other attempts are for naught. The emotions maybe wrong which
is a different story; what's important is that it is something someone
is feeling. The tough part is giving them a new emotion, while validating
that they are not wrong.
