SRE in charge of 2 direct security products in a team of 25. I also
manage/provision our internal Kubernetes cluster including standard
sysadmin responsibilities
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Designed and implemented application metrics which captured errors which
were eventually converted to P0 (user facing alerts), reducing the P0
stats by over 50%</li>
<li>Metrics redesign helped to negotiate a clear SLA with our stakeholders
with a enforced, data backed agreement of 99.9% which established a
Runbook</li>
<li>Correlated cpu, memory information which was piped into metrics with
host data to provided yearly estimates of resources using a simple
linear regression model.</li>
<li>Identified an intermittent race condition by initially using a
flamegraph generated by using a go profiler.</li>
<li>strace and gdb helped to identify a race condition due to futex<sub>wait</sub>
which helped in reducing the resource application and help boost
application perforance.</li>
<li>Stabilized apache Kafka platform which consistenly produces 76 Million
messages/sec. Identified critical bottlenecks and proposed redesign of
the system architecture to handle congestion. The system recovered
without any data loss.</li>
<li>Provisioned Hashicorp/vault in a high availability cluster backed by
Oracle KMS and a secondary vault to perform auto-unseal:
<a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/seal/ocikms">https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/seal/ocikms</a></li>
<li>Introduced blue-green/canary deployment concepts to infrastructure team
with 0 downtime upgrade of applications.</li>
<li>Reduced the runtime of Apache Flink job processing 20+Tb of data 10+
from 12+ hours to 4.</li>
<li>Managed, reviewed, provisioned host instances, deployed application as
K8s deployment/rollout/statefulset, scraped cluster metrics using
prometheus agent, and collected logs using Loki.</li>
<li>Conducted standard DevOps/Testing practices including regression
testing and torture tests</li>
<li>Actively prompted R&amp;D to use Alpine Linux based images by providing
example-led demonstration by reducing image size which saved in storage costs.</li>
<li>Introduced go-mmproxy which attaches client address infront of the TCP
packet header to preserve ip addresses in Layer 4 of the OSI model</li>
<li>Automated several dry operations which installs, provisions, fix various
adhoc tasks using python, go, and bash.</li>
<li>Regularly particpated in global-oncall with colleagues in 4 different
timezone, while managing internal customer requriements across 4
cultures.</li>
