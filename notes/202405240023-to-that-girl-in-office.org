Everyone processes emotions at their own pace. I'm weird in that I like to do
it straight away; it's a habit not out of my own choice.

Also, I'm sorry, in part cause I'm writing this to process mine, but also
asking you to read something, which you may not want to. Anyway, if you don't
read the entire thing below, at least read this part:

When i joined Bdance, i was recovering, still am. And over the last few
months, all the guys, especially you, helped me realize that it's important to
have fun.

In a way, it was mostly you who gave me the strength to look at life in a
better way. And I'm always always going to be grateful for it. It's not often
you get to truly thank someone for your life. 

This line in blue, is something I have this super gut feeling feeling that I
**need** to communicate this to you.

I'm sorry that you got caught up in my own anxious adventures. Yes, I'm very
anxious, and I have to thank another friend for pointing this out to me. This
too has been a blessing to know. Anyway, I actually want to have a
conversation with you, but I don't know how to proceed without triggering both
us and ruining whatever is left of this friendship.

I'll try to keep this about me, so that I can give you context. Context and
communication is important. And I hope you read this before you go to
Japan. If it's like me, Japan should help a lot with anxiety.

Anyway, I'm like Dr. House quite a bit. For some reason, I knew you would like
that show. I have a need to know on why/how, that's pretty much why i'm in
this line of work. If I don't, it bothers me, quite a lot.

Why am I saying this?

For some damn reason I care about you, and it's bothering me I can't explain
it. I asked you for dinner thinking maybe it's because I'm interested. I was
really hoping you'd say no, which you did - I am very happy about that. But I
still care.

Now, I know for a fact that I don't like you that way, i genuinely don't. I am
dating someone and it's going well, and I know I like this other person. I can
differentiate between the fact that I like her and whatever it is that is
making me care for you.

Kiddo, i have no idea why I have this care. I generally care about people a
lot, but the one I have for you caught me offguard. I have thought of some
reasons why:

I have waited almost my entire life to meet someone like me, and it just so
happens to be you, this is just a feeling. I hope I am wrong.

When i joined Bdance, i was recovering, still am. And over the last few
months, all the guys, especially you, helped me realize that it's important to
have fun.

In a way, it was mostly you who gave me the strength to look at life in a
better way. And I'm always always going to be grateful for it. It's not often
you get to truly thank someone for your life. In my view, you saved me in a
lot of ways.

This line in blue, is something I have this super gut feeling that I **need**
to communicate this to you.

I've been trying to build up, but anxiety does it's thing. I think you
probably understand that. There are like almost 8 things that I am anxious
about [mostly personal which I am not going to share] and my weird situation
with you is just 1 of them. So, I'm doing this in part to get some
understanding in me, but also in part that I do get to maintain a friendship
with you.

If i had time on my hands, I would slowly try to build it along. The issue is
that I don't. I've already began some preparation to leave, and it's a
certainty that I will try my damn hardest to do so when my PR results are out
in about Mid July, at least that's the current plan.

So, what's the purpose of this letter? Well, for one to give you context; two,
I have hope that I can amend this friendship. Then see where it goes. I am
going to continue to give you space as much as possible.

Btw, I finished the last episode of OneDay, it hit the spot right in the midst
of sweet depression. Thank you! 

Bro.
