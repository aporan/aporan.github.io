I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, you just got caught up in my own anxious
adventures. And yeah, yet anonther thing that we have in common.

I actually want to have a conversation with you, but I don't know how to
proceed without triggering both us and ruining whatever is left of this
friendship. So, that's why this letter.

I'll try to keep this about me, so that I can give you context. Context and
communication is important. And I hope you read this before you go to
Japan. If it's like me, Japan should remove all of your anxiety.

I'm like Dr. House quite a bit. I have a need to know on why/how, that's
pretty much why i'm in this line of work in programming. If I don't, it
bothers me, quite a lot. I don't care about being right, but usually, just
like him, I am. It's stubborness, I know, but I have worked quite a bit to
share it in a nice way. But anxiety does get the better of me.

Why am I saying this?

For some damn reason I care about you, and it's bothering me I can't explain
it. I asked you for dinner thinking maybe it's because I'm interested. I was
really hoping you'd say no, which you did - I am very happy about that. But it
didn't change.

Now, I know for a fact that I don't like you that way, i genuinely don't. I am
dating someone and it's going well, and I know I like this other person. I can
differentiate between the fact that I like her and whatever it is that is
making me care for you.

Dude, i have no idea at all what that is. I have thought of some reasons:

I have waited almost my entire life to meet someone like me, and it just so
happens to be you, this is just a feeling.

I don't actually know you per se. I know some bits about you in actuality

When i joined Bdance, i was recovering, still am. And over the last few
months, all the guys, especially you, helped me realize that it's important to
have fun.

In a way, it was mostly you who gave me the strength to look at life in a
better way. And I'm always always going to be grateful for it.

This line in blue, is something I feel like you need to know. The other stuff
might not be necessary, but for some reason, I feel like I **need** to
communicate this to you.

But well, i've been trying to build up, but anxiety does it's thing. I think
you understand that, and I don't have to elaborate. There are like almost 8
things that I am anxious about [mostly personal which I am not going to share]
and my weird situation with you is just 1 of them, so I'm doing this in part
to get some understanding in me, but also in part that I do get to maintain a
friendship with you. But like the other 7 things, it's not in my hands.

If i had time on my hands, I would slowly try to build it along. The issue is
that I don't. I've already began some preparation to leave, and it's a
certainty that I will try my damn hardest to do so when my PR results are out
in about Mid July, at least that's the current plan.

So, what now? I don't know. I'll still try to go for kopi breaks when I can,
and I have hope that I can amend this friendship. Then see where it goes

Btw, I finished the last episode of OneDay.
