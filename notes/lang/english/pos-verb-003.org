So far, we have learnt how to identify items by their names, places, ideas or
things and we call it a =Noun=. Now, we should be able to describe how they
are involved in a discussion or what they are doing or how they are doing - an
action that they are performing. The words which describes this and in doing
so starts the basic formation of a sentence is =The Verb=.

An analogy: A car consists of many parts: windows, tyres, seats. However, a
car is not a car if it doesn't move or run. The engine makes it do something -
move - and that's what a verb /does/. It takes all the items which has names,
connects them together, and makes it move.

And that example brings us to the fundamental law in verbs: The Subject Verb
Agreement.

** The Subject Verb Agreement

   A simple sentence which has a verb and a noun.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
   I eat.
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   "I" is the noun, and "eat" describes what I am doing. And importantly, the
   singular verb agrees with the singular noun.

   The idea behind the agreement is like above - The verb should always
   express the what the noun is doing in the correct way. 

   Well what's the correct way? Well, it's English. Here are some examples:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   Jake bakes a cake.
   We bake cakes.
   The dog barks.
   The dogs bark.
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   In all of the above, the subject is in agreement with the verb. There
   /might/ be a general rule, but every sentence is different.

** Types of Verbs

   With the fundamental rules out of the way, let's dive into categories of
   verbs. And just like Nouns, there are several.

*** Action
    
    The is the simple one. Most verbs are action verbs that is to say, they
    describe something that a noun is doing.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Astri said no.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    "said" is describing what "Astri" is doing.

*** Linking

    The verbs those help in connecting ideas (think Noun) together are,
    unsprisingly, called linking verbs.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    The bear is hungry.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Here "is" links hungry to the bear.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    The bear looked lonely.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    "looked" connects the idea of loneliness to the bear.

    That's it really. This is what a linking verb, also called, State of Being
    verbs are. There is the common list of them which are all derived from the
    master linking verb - "to be". They are: am, is, are, be, been, being, was
    and were.

    There are others as well, for example, "looked" in the example above. This
    is also an example of a verb which is /both/ an action and a linking
    verb. For example, in its action form:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    The bear looked at me.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    "looked" is an action the bear is performing.

*** Helping

    This class of verb helps to connect /other verbs/ thereby helping
    them. Hence, helping verbs. There is another name for this classification
    of verbs; it's also called "auxiliary" verbs.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    Brian is eating a pizza.
    Brian had been eating a pizza.
    I was bathing.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    "is", "had been", "was" aids the verb "eating" here. 

    Most of the helping verbs are forms of the verb "to be". And most of the
    time, they place the verb being helped in a particular timeline.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    She doesnâ€™t agree with me.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    "doesn't" helps the verb "agree" and it occurs in the present time.

**** Modals

     The auxiliary verbs themselves has a classification. These are helping
     verbs but they are grouped together because they have certain
     properties. They:

     * Agree with all subjects
     * They /don't/ have a to form.
     * And they express Modality.

     What's a Modality?

     Its "a particular mode in which something exists or is experienced or
     expressed". Basically, these verbs expresses different modes or
     conditions of the verb which is being helped.

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
     I can eat ten pounds of brocolli.
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     Here "can" express an ability of the verb "eat".

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     It may rain.
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     "may" implies a condition of the action "rain".

     There is only a handful of these verbs. The are: /may/, /might/, /must/,
     /can/, /could/, /should/, /would/, /shall/, and /will/.

*** Irregular

    Nouns aren't the only thing which are irregular. It's English, there's
    irregularity in verbs too. But, before we can proceed with explaining the
    irregularities, we need to defer this topic. 

    If you have not noticed yet, verbs has a second property. And before we
    can explain the irregularities, we need to understand this second
    property.

** Place in Time

   Re-visiting the definition of verbs which describes an action that a noun
   performs, another structural question is posed: when does the action occur?

   And that leads to the property: Verbs place a particular action in a
   certain time - the past, the present, and the future. These are called
   Verb Tense.

*** Present Tense

    These are the words which describes the action happening /right now/.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    Bertie is singing in the shower.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    "is singing", where "is" is a helping verb and "singing" is the main verb,
    denotes what Bertie is doing currently.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    The water is super cold.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    "is", a linking verb, describes the current temperature of the water.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    I eat donut.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    "eat" describes my action that I undertake in the current period.

    Unlike the tenses to follow, the basic present tense sentence has many
    different formation as the examples above illustrated:

    * adding -ing to the base verb after using a helping verb.
    * using "is" as a linking verb.
    * using the base verb directly.

*** Past Tense

    Verbs which describes action that a noun has /already done/. The general
    rule to convert a verb to its past form is: add in '-ed' to the base verb.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    I talked.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    "talked" is something i did before.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    I walked to the store.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    "walked" is something i did to reach the store.

*** Future Tense

    The third tense describes any action that is going to happen at some point
    of time in the future. Now there are two ways to form a future tense:

    1) add a 'will / shall'
    2) use 'is going'

    Although, the first one is more common and used more frequently, the
    second one has its use cases.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    I will eat donut.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    The addition of "will" just changes the sentence from the present form to
    the future.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    Lorraine is going to visit Canada.    
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    "is going" is used here, however, the implication of the sentence would be
    the same if it were "Lorraine will visit Canada". There is no change in
    its meaning.

** Verbs Third Law

   So far we know that verbs describes action and places the action at a
   particular frame of time. However, there /is/ a third aspect - the verb
   aspect.

   Verb aspect defines the /state of the action/ being performed. Its either
   state in which the action is waiting to be performed or was already
   performed i.e. it's stationary. Or it is being performed i.e. it's
   moving. And yes, I just created the verbs third Law: A verb which is moving
   will always be moving unless otherwise altered by a stationary aspect.

   There are 4 kinds of verb aspect:

   * Simple Aspect
   * Progressive Aspect
   * Perfect Aspect
   * Perfect Progresssive Aspect

   Each of the aspects places the state of the verb in a specific moment with
   in the each tense (think time).

*** Simple Aspect

    The base tense is the simple aspect. It describes some action which is
    done or can be done in any tense. (If it helps, think of it as the
    noun-ish form of the verb)

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    | Past     | Present | Future      |
    |----------+---------+-------------|
    | I walked | I walk  | I will walk |
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Here "walk" / "walked" is the /stationary/ state of the verb placed in
    three different times: Past, Present, and Future. The verb form changes
    depending on which tense (time) it is in, but the state doesn't change. 

*** Progressive Aspect
    
    The aspect which places verbs in the continous or ongoing state. 

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    | Past          | Present      | Future            |
    |---------------+--------------+-------------------|
    | I was walking | I am walking | I will be walking |
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    "walking" is an action which is happening or actively being
    done. Depending upon the tense, the conjugation will change to place the
    verb in the different times.

*** Perfect Aspect

    This aspect which defines the action of the verb being finished or
    completed. The Perfect aspect has a nuanced focus on the verb tense.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    I had washed the dishes.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    This is the Past tense of the perfect form. The Past Perfect places the
    verb state - the completed action - **before** a time in the current
    past. In the example above, "had washed" implies that "dishes" were
    already cleaned at before a time in the past. 

    Let's say it's 1700 hrs. Then a past time would be 1500 hrs. Continuing
    with the example above, "the dishes were washed" at 1300 hrs right after
    lunch time.

    In other words, the past perfect talks about a verb which took place
    (completed in this case) before the normal past tense as described from
    the present time.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    I have washed the dishes.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    This is the Present tense of the perfect form. The Present Perfect places
    the verb state before a time in the current present i.e. the past.

    "the dishes were washed" a few hours earlier.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    I will have washed the dishes.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    This is the Future tense of the perfect form. The Future Perfect plcaes
    the verab state before a time in the future i.e. the past of the current
    time in the future.

    If you shift the frame of the Present Perfect to the Future, that's what
    the Future Perfect describes.

    "the dishes will be washed" at a particular time before 2300 hrs. Because
    that's sleeping time.

*** Perfect Progressive
    
    This is an interesting one. Perfect Progressive aspect describes an
    ongoing task that has been completed. It is exactly similar to the Past
    Perfect except that it describes the continous state of the verb.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    | Past Perfect P.    | Present Perfect P.  | Future Perfect P.        |
    |--------------------+---------------------+--------------------------|
    | I had been walking | I have been walking | I will have been walking |
    #+END_EXAMPLE

** Irregular Verbs

   After the mastery of time, we can finally re-visit the Irregularity of the
   Verbs. And there are many different ones. 

   The most common ones are the helping verbs: be, have. They are used in
   almost all sentences and as you might have already seen from the previous
   examples, they are used in all the tenses and all the aspects.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
   | Verb | 1st Person | 3rd Person | Plural Present | 1st Past | Plural Past |
   |------+------------+------------+----------------+----------+-------------|
   | be   | I am       | She is     | We are         | I was    | We were     |
   | have | I have     | She has    | We have        | I had    | We had      |
   #+END_EXAMPLE

*** Funk-ed

    The verb which is =ed='d  for its past form in both spelling and sound.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    | Past   | Present |
    |--------+---------|
    | Walked | Walk    |
    | Slept  | Sleep   |
    | Kept   | Keep    |
    | Built  | Build   |
    | Spent  | Spend   |
    | Left   | Leave   |
    | Lept   | Leap    |
    | Lost   | Lose    |
    #+END_EXAMPLE

*** Vowel Shift

    Verbs whose vowel changes as it moves between the tenses and aspects. The
    enunciation moves from the front of the mount to the back.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    | Present | Past  | Past Perfect |
    |---------+-------+--------------|
    | Sing    | Sang  | Sung         |
    | Drink   | Drank | Drunk        |
    | Win     | Won   | Won          |
    | Find    | Found | Found        |
    | Sit     | Sat   | Sat          |
    | Sneak   | Snuck | Snuck        |
    | Run     | Ran   | Run          |
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    And as always, there will be exceptions. For example, "run" above.

*** Vowel Shift's which are Taken

    These are the bunch of vowel shift Verbs whose Past Perfect form has the
    'en' ending.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    | Present | Past       | Past Perfect |
    |---------+------------+--------------|
    | Tear    | Tore       | Torn         |
    | Show    | Showed     | Shown        |
    | Prove   | Proved     | Proven       |
    | Bite    | Bit        | Bitten       |
    | Ride    | Rode       | Ridden       |
    | Eat     | Ate        | Eaten        |
    | Speak   | Spoke      | Spoken       |
    | Be      | Was / Were | Been         |
    | Go      | Went       | Gone         |
    #+END_EXAMPLE
