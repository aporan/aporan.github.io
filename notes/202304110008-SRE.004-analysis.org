* Static

  Nothing much to explain. The toolkits here check the raw codes /
  configuration files to check for known Vulnerabilites.

* Dynamic

  Technique to analyse running application for security vulnerabilities. One
  of biggest pivot poing about Dynamic Analysis is about Spidering. The better
  the spidering job, the better the application results.

  1. Usually, DA scans takes longer than 10 minutes or so, so it's important
     to safer to run this in non-blocking path
  2. Spidering is an active part of the dynamic analysis process
  3. There are many separate tool kits for this, crossing many different
     domains: 
     * nmap,
     * sslyze
     * zap proxy
     * nikto
