* Named Pipes

  Pipe's =|= allow's to pass one commands output to the next command. In bash,
  one can have /named pipes/.

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  mkfifo <pipe-name>
  # or 
  mknod p <pipe-name>
  #+END_SRC

  Everything is a file, and every file has permissions, and that can be
  reviewed by either using:
