Dry-eyes, I did not know it was an actual condition of the eyes. The initial
diagnosis from the doctor, I merely thought, your eyes are dry and you just
need a lubricant - just like how your skin would be dry and one needs some
moisturizer. However, it is far more complex that a simple dryness. It can
become a *chronic* condition

* Tear Film Layers

In order to understand dryness, let's have a look at the tear-film layers:

The three layers essentially protect your cornea, without which the cornea can
get damaged. This would effectively lead to distortion of image or eventual
vision loss. The three layers are:

1. Lipid Layer [Oil]
2. Aqueous Layer
3. Mucous Layer

In some cases, the 2nd and 3rd can be considered a 'single' layer, termed
mucoaqueous layer with a bit of a gradient.

More information about each of the layers can be found online. The reference
to this [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears][wikipedia article]] is a good start. In this article, I only reference
the first two layers:

** Lipid Layer

The main function of this layer is to protect the inner layers from
evaporation. It's made up of a complex mixture of lipids that is made from
Meibomian Glands. It could also happen due to Environmental reasons.

** Aqueous Layer

The layer contains a plethora of salt and other proteins. The changing of the
salt content can lead to various conditions of the eyes.


In either case, if the tear film is damaged, it can lead to corneal damage
which can cause changes in vision - from changes in astigmatism to vision
loss.

For dry-eye-disease (ded), there are essentially ~two~ *three* categories of
dry eyes:

1. Aqueous Deficiency dry eyes,
2. Evaporative dry eyes,
3. Mixed (which is the most common form)

A good introduction summary of the reasons of why this may happen is
introduced in the video:

** Further Information and Treatments

For a long detailed information about the topic, please watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH7ELystIb0][Tear Dysfunction
Syndrome]]. In general, in my opinion, the treatment is broadly classified in
two categories:

1. Symptoms: External therapies which helps to mitigate the evaporation of
   tear film
2. Food: Internal consumption of food or supplements which helps regulate the
   hole body

In my case, consuming omega-3 seems to have helped significantly. This
/anecdotal/ opinion certainly leads me to believe that I had an inflammation
in my body. It could also be something else, afterall, I am not a doctor at
all.
