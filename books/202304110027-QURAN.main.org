Religion is baffling in our current times, however, it does provide us with
useful information, anecdotes, guidance and an alternate perspective which is
thoughtful, humbling, devastating, inquisitive and beautiful.

In our ever divided world, there is a disparity between rich and the poor
wherein most of the worlds wealth is under the richec's control. Likewise,
most religious knowledge is ordained by very specific people.

If religion is meant to be first and foremost an individual endeavor, it seems
to me the individual lacks the appropriate approach to think about it by
themselves. How are they supposed to bring together a communal understanding
if they only follow without questioning.

If the defining attribute of Homo Sapien is our abilitiy to think then each
individual should utilize its maximum potential, and reason to understand this
guideline of information in all perspectives as possible.

Perhaps, science can teach us how to use the skill.

In mathematics or physics, the rules of an equation by itself is very narrowly
useful without knowing the application and its usecase in its
environment. Likewise, it is also very cruel to use and apply the texts of
philosophical and religious books without understanding its environment and
unveiling its perspectives.

Every individual has the capacity to understand elementary science subjects
inlcuding physics, math, biology and geography. And also learn active
applicable skills from social classes where the application of thinking and
reasoning is present. The religious texts should also be incorporated and
understood by the same means.

The texts are not the sole responsibility of a few specific individuals. It is
everyones. Hence, this is an attempt in understanding, unveiling the
perspective prescribed in the Quran from an average individual, /in simple
terms/, where the text is subjected to an environment.

The approach of this document is simple:

- Provide the impression (the application) of verse
- And its important points along with a summary.

The document is segregated according to surahs from the Quran.

** [[Surah 1: Al-Nisa (The Cow)]]
